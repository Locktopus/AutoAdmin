Code explanation :

The code is splitted in 3.
First, you have the main function "AutoAdmin.py", which contain the parsing function and redirect user to the other functions.
The you have the "use" function and the "set" function, which contain different module that everyone can add easily by adding it in the parsing portion
of the code and then in a module file that will be used by either "use" or "set" function.
Simple as that !
